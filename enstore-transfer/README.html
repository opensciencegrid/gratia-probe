<h1>Enstore Transfer Probe</h1>
<p>NOTES</p>
<ul><li>This probe runs only twice a day</li>
<li>By default it is collecting data up to 6 hours before the probe is invoked (InputDelay=6*3600=21600), to wait for transfers to complete</li>
    <li>You can adjust delays and overlaps but using InputMinInterval, InputDelay, CheckpointRollback</li>
</ul>
